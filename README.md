# Web Template

This can be used for quickly setting up a web project using the Yarn package manager, React, ES6, and Babel. First, you'll need to make sure Yarn is installed. If you already have npm installed, you can just run

`npm install --global yarn`

to get Yarn. Then you can simply run `yarn` in the root of the project to install the dependencies. Lastly, since we have Webpack as a dependency we can start the server with

`./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --progress --colors`

and head to `localhost:8080` to see the site.
